# Movie-Genre-Classification
Movie Genre Classification using Machine Learning  This project builds a machine learning model that predicts the genre of a movie based on its plot summary. Using TF-IDF vectorization and classical ML models like Logistic Regression, the system learns patterns in text data to accurately classify unseen movie plots into genres.
